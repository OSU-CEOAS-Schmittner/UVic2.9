the Old_mobi.F file here is the mobi with out the npp and calcite production sinks applied to the C_soft and C_CaCO3

also it does not have the revised C_CaCO3 tracer, which originally was sourced by dissl and/or rdissl in the same location and methodology
as DIC. That original method wasn't working. so now in the new version (name mobi.F) the C_CaCO3 is sourced by dissl/rdissl in the same location
as C_soft and the other biological variables.
