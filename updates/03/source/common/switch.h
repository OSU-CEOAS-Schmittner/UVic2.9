!====================== include file "switch.h" ========================

!     all time dependent decisions are made by time manager "tmngr.F"
!     and communicated elsewhere to the model via logical switches.

!     inputs: (defaulted in "blkdta.F", optionally reset via namelist)

!     runlen  = integration period (see rununits). note "runlen" should
!               be an integral number of density time steps. if not,
!               then "runlen" is automatically adjusted to insure this.
!               fractional days are supported but not fractional months
!               or years.
!     rununits= units of "runlen". may be "days", "months", or "years".
!               tmngr will convert "runlen" which is in "rununits"
!               to "rundays" in units of days.

!     segtim  = the integration time "runlen" is broken into a number of
!               segments each of length "segtim" days. updated surface
!               boundary conditions are applied to MOM every "segtim"
!               days. this is useful when coupling to atmospheric models
!               in which case both models exchange surface boundary
!               conditions every "segtim" days where "segtim"
!               is 1/(coupling frequency). without an atmospheric model,
!               when getting surface boundary conditions from data,
!               "segtim" is set to the time step (in days) by mom.F. in
!               either case, "runlen" (in days) should be an integral
!               number of "segtim".

!     nmix    = number of time steps between mixing timesteps. used
!               to damp timestep splitting due to centred leapfrog.

!     init    = (true,false)  indicates that this run is a
!               (start from initial conditions, restart)

!     initbgc = (true,false)  indicates that this run is a
!               (start from initial BGC conditions, restart)

!     restrt  = (true,false) = (do,don`t) write a restart at the end
!               of the run

!     eb      = (true,false) configures for the use of a
!               (euler backward,forward) type mixing timestep

!     init_time     = (true,false) sets restarts to initial time

!     init_time_in  = (true,false) sets input restart to initial time

!     init_time_out = (true,false) sets output restart to initial time

!     inputs to tmngr.F: diagnostic intervals
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------

!     note: switches are used to control the interval between doing
!           diagnostics. units for all switches are in days.
!           setting a switch < 0.0 disables whatever the switch is
!           controlling. setting it = 0.0 causes the diagnostic to be
!           done every time step, and setting it > 0.0 causes the
!           diagnostic to be done repeatedly on the specified interval.

!               not necessary to keep writing a time independent field

!     each interval switch needs three variables in common. The
!     following naming convention is used.

!         1) an interval (real) for diagnostic output (e.g,.  glenint)
!         2) a switch (logical) for the interval (e.g.,  glents )

!     the third is an internal variable needed by the time manager
!     to support calculation of the logical switch

!         3) an index (integer)                       (e.g., iglenint)

!     the user must specify the interval [e.g., glenint] for diagnostic
!     output in units of days. tmngr sets the corresponding logical
!     switch [e.g., glents] every time step. It is set to true when
!     within half a time step of the requested interval, otherwise it is
!     false. All decisions relating to the interval [e.g., glenint]
!     are based on the logical switch [e.g., glents].

!     internal time structures

!     The switch index [e.g., iglenint] is used to subsrcipt into
!     internal arrays maintained by tmngr.F. The switch index is
!     allocated on the first call to function "alarm".
!     The array entry [e.g., iinterval(iglenint)] is a time index to the
!     internal representation of the interval [e.g., glenint].
!     The array entry [e.g., ialarm(iglenint)] is a time index to the
!     next time the alarm will be true.

!     each averaging period switch needs five variables in common. The
!     following naming convention is used.

!         1) an interval (real) for diagnostic output    (e.g. xbtint  )
!         2) a switch (logical) for the interval         (e.g. xbtts   )
!         3) an averaging period (real)                  (e.g. xbtper  )
!         4) a switch (logical) for accumulating         (e.g. xbtperts)

!     the third is an internal variable needed by the time manager
!     to support calculation of the logical switches

!         5) an index (integer)                         (e.g. ixbtint  )

!     The user must specify the interval [e.g., xbtint] for diagnostic
!     output in units of days and the averaging period [e.g., xbtper]
!     in units of days. The averaging period may be less than or equal
!     to the interval. For example, if the interval is 30.0 days and the
!     averaging period is 5.0 days, results will be averaged over all
!     time steps within days 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.  An averaging period
!     of 0.0 days averages over the last time step of the interval (as
!     does xbtper = dt), and an averaging period less than zero turns
!     the switches off for all time steps.

!     The logical switch for writing output at the specified interval
!     [e.g., xbtts] is set to true on the last time step of the
!     averaging period. The logical switch for accumulating results
!     [e.g., xbtperts] is true for all time steps within the averaging
!     period, otherwise it is false.

!     internal time structures

!     The index [e.g., ixbtint] is allocated on the first call to
!     function "avg_alarm". The array element iperiod(ixbtint) is an
!     index to the time structure for the internal representation of
!     "xbtper", and ilastsw(ixbtint) is the index of the switch that
!     flags the last time step of the accumulation period.
!     Depending on use,  ilastsw(ixbtint) may either be the index
!     of another "named" switch or the index of a new switch
!     allocated on the first time step.
!     In the latter case, iinterval(ilastsw(ixbtint)) is the index of
!     the time structure where "xbtint" is stored in internal form,
!     and ialarm(ilastsw(ixbtint)) is the index of the time when an
!     accumulation period will next end.
!     The variable nextts(ixbtint) is true whenever the next
!     time step will begin the accumulation period.

!     the following logical switches are based on any calendar or
!     interval switch and an averaging period (in days). The  averaging
!     period must be less than or equal to the interval. The last
!     time step of the averaging period is at the end of the interval.
!     If the averaging period is set to zero, the averaging period
!     consists only of the last time period of the interval.  If
!     the averaging period is less than zero, these switches are always
!     false.

!     each averaging period switch needs four variables in common. For
!     example, if the averaging period is before the end of each month
!     then the calendar switch (eomon), and index (ieomon) are presumed
!     to exist in common and need not be added.

!     Additionally, four items are needed.

!       1) an averaging period (real)                  (e.g.  testper  )
!       2) a switch (logical) for accumulating results (e.g.  testperts)
!       3) a switch (logical) for the end of interval  (e.g.  testts   )

!     the fourth is an internal variable needed by the time manager
!     to support calculation of the logical switch

!       4) an index (integer)                          (e.g.  itestper )

!     Suppose it is required to produce averages over all time steps
!     during the last 5 days of each month. Then "testper" = 5.0 and
!     the following will calculate the accumulating switch.

!      testts = avg_alarm(itestper, ihalfstep, 0, testper, iref, ieomon)
!      testperts = on(itestper)

!     Note the use of "ieomon" to key off the months.  The switch
!     "testts" will be true whenever "eomon" is true.
!     Also note that when an averaging switch is keyed off another
!     switch, the switch interval argument is not used, but is
!     retained for consistency with the form of other averaging
!     switches.
