## Welcome to OSU's UVic Pages

This is the version of the University of Victoria (UVic) climate model (version 2.9) developed and used at [Oregon State University's](https://oregonstate.edu/) (OSU) [College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) by the research group led by [Andreas Schmittner](https://andreasschmittner.github.io/). 

### Collaboration

We collaborate with various groups around the world in this effort. Notably [Andreas Oschlies'](https://www.geomar.de/en/aoschlies) group at GEOMAR in Kiel, [Mike Eby](http://terra.seos.uvic.ca/) the University of Victoria, and [Katrin Meissner](http://web.science.unsw.edu.au/~katrinmeissner/) at the University of New South Wales. 

This page is in development. More information is available on [my fork](https://github.com/andreasschmittner/UVic2.9/wiki).
